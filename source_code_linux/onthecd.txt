On the CD-ROM

The CD-ROM contains the example programs and scripts that are demonstrated
in the text "GNU/Linux Application Programming."  The following identifies
the contents of each of the subdirectories on this CD-ROM.


System Requirements

Sample applications on this CD-ROM will run on any Linux distribution that
utilizes a 2.6 Linux kernel.  These applications were developed on the 
Fedora and Ubuntu Linux distributions.


Software by Chapter

./software/ch6 ("Building Software with GNU/Make")

This subdirectory contains sample Makefiles, ranging from simple to more
complex (including variable manipulation and dependency tracking).


./software/ch7 ("Building and Using Libraries")

This subdirectory contains programs that illustrate the use of libraries
on GNU/Linux.  Under ./software/ch7/statshrd are examples for static/shared
libraries, and under ./software/ch7/dynamic are shared/dynamic libraries.


./software/ch32 ("Coverage Testing with gcov")

This subdirectory provides sample applications that are used to demonstrate
the gcov GNU coverage analysis tool.


./software/ch33 ("Profiling with gprof")

This subdirectory provides sample applications that are used to illustrate
the gprof GNU profiling tool.


./software/ch8 ("Building packages with automake/autoconf")

This subdirectory contains sample scripts to demonstrate the GNU automake
and autoconf tools.


./software/ch11 ("File Handling in GNU/Linux")

This subdirectory contains sample applications that demonstrate the GNU/Linux
file handling APIs.


./software/ch12 ("Programming with Pipes")

This subdirectory contains example applications for pipes programming.  In
addition, a sample application that illustrates the dup system call is
provided.


./software/ch13 ("Introduction to Sockets Programming")

Sample programs that demonstrate sockets programming are provided in this
subdirectory.  In addition to C programs to explore client and server
applications, a sample Ruby language server and Scheme language based
client are provided.


./software/ch14 ("GNU/Linux Process Model")

Applications that demonstrate the variety of APIs and techniques for the
standard GNU/Linux process model are provided in this subdirectory.  Sample
applications demonstrate forking, raising and catching signals, POSIX signals,
and others.


./software/ch15 ("POSIX Threads Programming")

In this subdirectory are sample applications that demonstrate POSIX threads
programming.  Sample application include creation of threads, thread signals,
joining threads, thread mutexes and thread-based condition variables.


./software/ch16 ("IPC with Message Queues")

The sample programs that demonstrate inter-process communication with
message queues is provided in this subdirectory.  The programs demonstrate
message queue creation, deletion, configuration, statistics collection,
and reading and writing messages.


./software/ch17 ("Synchronization with Semaphores")

In this subdirectory, the sample programs that illustrate programming
with semaphores are provided.  This includes programs that illustrate
semaphore creation and deletion, acquisition and release, and others.


./software/ch18 ("Shared Memory Programming")

The varieties of sample programs that demonstrate shared memory programming
are provided in this subdirectory.  This includes programs that illustrate
shared memory region creation, deletion, configuration and process attach
and detach.

./software/ch19 ("Advanced File Handling")

This subdirectory contains a number of example programs for advanced file
techniques including filesystem event monitoring, file typing, filesystem
enumeration, and others.


./software/ch20 ("Other Application Development Topics")

This subdirectory contains a variety of demonstration programs that illustrate
a number of application development topics (from command-line argument
parsing, to the use of time functions, to physical memory mapping).


./software/ch21 ("Standard GNU/Linux Commands")

The sample scripts and data files used to demonstrate the most useful
GNU/Linux commands are provided in this subdirectory.


./software/ch22 ("Bourne Again Shell (bash)")

This subdirectory contains a number of sample bash scripts that illustrate
a wide variety of constructs within the bash scripting language.


./software/ch23 ("Editing with Sed")

This subdirectory contains sample Sed scripts and sample data files used by 
the scripts.


./software/ch24 ("Text Processing with Awk")

This subdirectory contains a number of sample Awk scripts and sample data
files used by the scripts.


./software/ch25 ("Building Parsers with Flex and Bison")

In this subdirectory, the sample lexer and grammar files are provided for 
three different sample applications.  The first simple example, under 
./ch25/simple, is the first example of a flex lexer file.  The second 
example, ./ch25/setexample, illustrates the consolidation of both the 
lexer and grammar files into a single application.  Finally, under 
./ch25/config, is a slightly more complex example of a configuration file 
parser.


./software/ch29 ("Software Testing Tools")

Four methods of software testing are covered in this subdirectory.  A 
"build-your-own" approach is covered in ./ch29/byo, the C-Unit test system 
is covered in ./ch29/cut, the Embedded Unit Test framework in ./ch29/emb,
and finally a script that utilizes expect to provide high-level black-box
testing in ./ch29/expect.


./software/ch30 ("Using GDB")

The sample application used to demonstrate the GNU debugger is found in 
this subdirectory.
